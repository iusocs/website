            What is cognitive science? Some say it is the study of the mind, thought, and learning, others will define it as the intersection of several fields involving psychology, philosophy, computer science, linquistics, anthropology, and neuroscience. Those are fascinating and broad areas of study, but does the definition even end there? Biology, environmental science, social science, politcal science, economics, informatics and more can be part of cognitive science. SOCS is a community of students dedicated to discovering what cognitive science is and how it relates to their own topics of interest, whatever they may be. Join us weekly on Tuesday evenings 5pm at PY128 for our discussions over pizza with faculty and researchers from all around IU's campus and beyond.
