        Every Tuesday, anyone is invited to attend our weekly discussions and lectures with faculty and/or grad students about their research here at IU or elsewhere. Topics include computer science, linguistics, philosophy, psychology, neuroscience, artificial intelligence, or any possible combination of such as long as it's related to cognitive science in any way. Oh, and there's free food.

        SOCS is a great way for anyone interested in cognitive science or research to network with other students and faculty and find out what area of cognitive science is most engaging for you. Our weekly meetings demonstrate just how fascinating and broad cognitive science can be, so even if you have the slightest interest in cognitive science or want to major in it but you aren't sure, come to a meeting!

            Hello! My name is Morgan Klutzke, and I’m a sophomore studying cognitive science and psychology. Although my main interest lies in behavior and cognition, I’m always excited to see the variety of fields in which cognitive science can be applied. Some of my favorites include human-computer interaction, game design, and linguistics. Although I’m relatively new to SOCS, I’m very excited to be helping facilitate an environment of learning and fun!

            Hello! My name is Keiland Cooper, (that's me on the right) and I am a Senior studying Cognitive science, Neuroscience, and Computer science. I've been passionate about what our brains can do since I first saw a diagram in a medical textbook when I was young, and have been hooked ever since. Today, I study the neural mechanisms of memory by recording from the brain, as well as theoretical and computational models of how it may function. I've also taken an interest in philosophy recently as well, and recently put out a paper in the area. When I have free time, I'm either playing guitar, snowboarding, hiking/camping, or typing something on my laptop. I plan to go to graduate school after uni, and would like to work in the interface between neuroscience and Artificial Intelligence. For more information about me, stop by my website at <a href="http://www.kwcooper.xyz">www.kwcooper.xyz</a> and feel free to reach out to me  at <a href="mailto:kc42@iu.edu?Subject=Hey%20there">kc42@iu.edu</a> with any questions, comments, or cool jokes!.
