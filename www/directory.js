We are also interested in individual differences in speech recognition under degraded listening conditions and high cognitive load. Research is also being carried out on problems related to hearing loss in both adults and children who have received cochlear implants as a medical intervention for profound bilateral sensory-neural hearing loss. We are happy to interview cognitive science undergraduates, especially sophomores and juniors who might like to gain some first hand experience working in an active research group so you can see what our field has to offer you.",

The main topics under investigation are how listeners adapt to the variability present in the speech signal, how listeners cognitively represent accent and dialect variability, and how children develop the ability to accurately perceive highly variable speech signals.

        "description":"Our research focuses on the development of embodied cognition in infants, children, and adults.  We are especially interested in how they perceive and interpret the actions of others, and how this perception of others' actions influences their own actions.  Specific research topics include joint attention and joint action, prediction of biological and non-biological actions, perception of affordances, the role of mimicry and imitation in learning and self-regulation, and attention and decision making in risky digital environments.  This research is conducted with behavioral (response times, observational coding, kinematic analyses of human movement, eye tracking), physiological (heart rate, pupillometry, repiration), and neurophysiological (EEG, ERP) methods.  Research assistants gain direct experience creating stimuli, testing participants, coding behavior, and analyzing data.",

Lab members explore the connections between HRI, human social behavior and cognition, and the emerging social meanings and consequences of robotic through a variety of methods, including prototyping and evaluation of interactive robot technologies, field studies of robot use in naturalistic contexts, and experimental studies of psychological and cognitive aspects of HRI. The diverse people and projects in the lab are united by a shared interest in discovering the social mechanisms of HRI that can be implemented in future robot design and understanding the broader societal consequences of robots.",
