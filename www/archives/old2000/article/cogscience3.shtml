<i>Rob Nosofsky was always good at mathematics, but he also was fascinated by what makes people tick. So when it came to a career choice, he decided to combine his interests and become a mathematical psychologist. His specialty, the study of the categorization of objects, falls under the heading of cognitive psychology and has led Nosofsky to integrate his work with other areas of cognitive science. Recognized as an international leader in his field and as a first-class teacher, Nosofsky is the winner of the College's 1998 Distinguished Faculty Award.

<br><br>When you're sitting in your backyard and you spot a feathered animal flying overhead, your brain quickly determines that the animal is a bird - a simple enough process, on the face of it. But have you ever thought about the steps your brain has to take in order to make such a categorization?
<br><br>How and why people categorize concepts and events, objects and faces, is at the heart of Professor of Psychology Rob Nosofsky's work. Nosofsky approaches the study of categorization through mathematical psychology, formulating and applying mathematical models to test theories and conduct experiments. 
<br><br>He also is one of a new breed of researchers who are crossing over into related disciplines that fall under the heading of cognitive science. In Nosofsky's case, that means forays into the field of medical science, where modeling techniques have been used to devise computer algorithms - procedures for solving mathematical problems - that enhance the accuracy of radiologists' diagnosis of X-rays.
<br><br>"The radiologist has experienced thousands of different X-rays during his lifetime," Nosofsky explains. "He has to determine whether an X-ray represents this type of disease or that type of disease. There are multiple cues that would signal which category an X-ray would belong to. Somehow, on the basis of his experience, the radiologist has learned to make this categorization. I'm interested in what is going on in his mind. How is he able to do it? What has he stored in his memory that allows him to make this categorization?"
<br><br>Nosofsky has devised his own model to answer these questions. In laboratory experiments, he asks subjects to categorize colors by placing them in category A or category B, then observes the process by which they determine to which category each color belongs. He has concluded that subjects make choices based on precedent.

<br><br>"The model I think works best says that people store a vast number of individual examples of categories in their memories," he says. "When people see some new object, somehow the mind is comparing the similarity of that object to all the different examples in the memory."
<br><br>Nosofsky has used the results of his experiments to develop a model that could be used in disease diagnosis. A computer algorithm similar to the one he has devised has already been shown to improve accuracy in the interpretation of mammograms and shows promise for other medical diagnoses, such as the detection of prostate cancer. Nosofsky's model has not yet been tested by radiologists in a clinical setting, but he believes it could yield even better results than the models already in use. He also is working with researchers at the IU School of Medicine to help understand categorization in patients in the early stages of Alzheimer's disease.
<br><br>Nosofsky's work has been uniformly praised by his fellow scientists. Not only did he develop a model for categorization, he also extended the model to apply to the classification, identification, and recognition of objects. Known as the "generalized context model," it has been called a "tour de force that may be unequaled in the field of experimental psychology" and a "quantum jump in the knowledge of perceptual and cognitive processes." 
<br><br>Nosofsky is more modest about his achievements. "I would characterize my work not so much as making a breakthrough as unifying and integrating successful theories in distinct domains," he says. "I'm lucky to be in a situation where I'm always learning. When your career always revolves around something you find exciting and interesting, you can't ask for better than that."
