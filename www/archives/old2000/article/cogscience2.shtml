<font face="Arial" size=4><b>Freethinking students</b></font>
<br><br>No doubt much of the field's appeal for students is derived from its breadth and sense of freedom. 
<br><br>"It's possible to be a cognitive science major and study a very wide variety of things," says Tony Chemero, who recently completed his PhD in philosophy and cognitive science at IU. That unique brand of flexibility is a breath of fresh air for freethinking undergraduates. 
<br><br>Michael Gasser, associate professor of computer science and linguistics, characterizes CIS majors as "probably students who don't feel they fit into any single department," and that's a description not limited to the student body. Gasser describes his own interests as lying "somewhere near the place where linguistics, computer science, and psychology meet. Thus the only term that really fits me anymore is cognitive science."
<br><br>Most students who are intellectually curious and unconventional are excited to stumble across a relative anomaly like IU's CIS program. "A prospective student from Massachusetts found our Web page," Stephan says, "and e-mailed me and said, 'I'm so glad I found you!' " Stephan laughs, pleased. "I said, 'I'm glad you found us too!' "
<br><br>Intellectual vigor, real-world relevance, classroom dynamics, and a collegial sense of community are all very real benefits of the program, but the first question interested students typically ask Stephan is "What can I do with cognitive science?" Read: "Will I wind up a really insightful gas station attendant?" Not surprisingly, it's common for new graduates to head off to graduate school and for graduate students to go on to university faculty positions, but the other "real-world" employment opportunities are many and diverse. Stephan has received interested inquiries from several employers, "especially in technological industries." Anticipated career paths for CIS graduates include telecommunications, multimedia, education, and information processing.<P><table border=0 hspace=6 cellpadding=10 align=right width=200>

<br><br><font face="Arial" size=4><b>Intellectual credibility</b></font>
<br><br>For such a young discipline, cognitive science has encountered surprisingly little resistance from employers and other academics.
<br><br>"There's always the issue of the intellectual credibility of a new field," notes Chemero. "But cognitive science has generally gotten past this, primarily by getting results that are both good science and good technology." 
<br><br>Many tools that were originally designed for research purposes in cognitive science, for instance, have become major commercial goods. Examples of that crossover include the handwriting recognition programs used in the Apple Newton and Thinkpad computers; speech recognition software used in IBM's Via Voice product; the fuzzy-logic chips in your toaster and refrigerator; and your kid's Lego robot kit.
<br><br>It also doesn't hurt that the field has high-profile boosters like Noam Chomsky, Marvin Minsky, and IU's own 
<br><br>Douglas Hofstadter. Hofstadter - who teaches not only in cognitive science and computer science, but is also an adjunct professor in the history and philosophy of science, philosophy, comparative literature, and psychology departments - is the author of the 1980 Pulitzer Prize-winning book Godel, Escher, Bach, which has been devoured by many a prospective student.
<br><br>Hofstadter's work - which involves developing computer programs to simulate high-level human thought and creativity - is only one element in the broad and diverse body of research generated by CIS faculty. Rob Goldstone conducts psychological experiments to study people's acquisition and development of concepts; Michael Gasser works on training computer systems to learn natural language; Richard Shiffrin develops and contrasts theories of memory retrieval; Elinor Ostrom examines human choices and decision making within the structures of political science; Brian Cantwell Smith's investigations run the gamut from artificial intelligence to feminist philosophy of science. The breadth of the faculty's interests is one of the CIS program's strengths.

<br><br>Chemero points out that the CIS program has received "lots of National Science Foundation and National Institute of Mental Health grants, and too many awards to mention."  
<br><br>"It's a hot field right now," Stephan says. "I get requests for information from other universities thinking of starting their own programs, and software developed by our faculty for our courses is being packaged so others can use it. We want to sell our own program, of course, but an integral part of doing that is contributing to the growth of cognitive science across the country."
<br><br>Besides, as easily as CIS crosses the seemingly impenetrable boundaries between academic departments, it's bound to transcend geographical and institutional separations as well. Which is no surprise: Communication is a fundamental element of an interdisciplinary pursuit like cognitive science. 
<br><br>"It's a broad subject with many subdisciplines," observes Kyle Wagner. "They're just all related by communicating with each other more tightly than they might otherwise be. Normally, for instance, I'd have no vocabulary in common with a neuroscientist. But cognitive science has sort of merged the vocabularies of all of these related fields."
<br><br>Now if only it would make it easier for Kyle to explain to his family and friends what he does. Oh, well. All in good time.
