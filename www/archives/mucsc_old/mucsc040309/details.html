<h1>MUCSC - Details</h1>
<p><em>Submission date changed to February 12!</em></p>
<p>The due date for submissions has been moved to Thursday, February 12th to provide additional time for this announcement to proliferate.  Already submitted abstracts and papers may be revised and resubmitted, if desired.  We will still notify presenters by March 4th.</p>

<p>We would like to reiterate that all undergraduate students are welcome to attend all parts of the conference, including the keynote address by Douglas Hofstadter, regardless of whether they are presenting, and that the conference will have no registration fee. Transportation and lodging are the responsibility of attendees.</p>
</p>
<p>Presentations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Presentations will be 10-15 minutes in length, with a 5-10 minute question period after the talk.  Presentations are on either Saturday or Sunday afternoons.</li>
<li>Papers are to be approximately 3-6 pages in length, containing an abstract, introduction, methods, data, and analysis.  You are expected to finish data collection and analysis by the conference date (April 4).  A strong preference will be given to papers with completed analysis.</li>
</ul></p>

<p>Posters:
<ul>
<li>Poster presentations will occur Saturday night, following the keynote.</li>
<li>Abstracts for poster submissions should include a title, brief introduction to the subject matter, and a brief overview of the project.</li></ul></p>

<p>General:
<ul><li>Assisting faculty or mentors should be listed either as co-authors or in an acknowledgements section, depending on the level of their contribution to the students original research.</li>
