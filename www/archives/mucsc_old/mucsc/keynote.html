    <b>AI Claims versus Cog-Sci Aims</b><br />
    <br />
Douglas Hofstadter&nbsp;<br />
    Center for Research on Concepts and Cognition<br />
    Indiana University<br />
    <br />
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; AI started out in the late 1940's as a profound scientific
    endeavor -- to create thinking machines.&nbsp; Over its several decades of existence,
    however, it has metamorphosed (and perhaps predictably so, had there been a sufficiently
    foresightful predictor, back in those early days) into a random hodge-podge of military,
    industrial, and technological goals.&nbsp; From initially being a serious and humble
    effort to lay bare the human mind's complex and subtle secrets, AI has rapidly degraded
    into an largely amoral dog-eat-dog fight for funding in which loud and preposterous
    claims of sudden giant revolutionary steps forward compete against realistic descriptions
    of modest and gradual progress consisting of small insights -- and guess which type
    of self-description tends to bring home the bacon in this deplorable tooth-and-nail
    battle for money?<br />
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In my talk, I will talk about some of the louder voices in
    this bizarrely ruleless bazaar, and will briefly describe some of the projects that,
    though they may have grabbed great attention, have delivered essentially nothing
    of use, and I will also talk about some projects that have delivered some perhaps
    useful or interesting technology but that have nothing to do with understanding
    the human mind, and that perhaps never claimed to.&nbsp; Finally I will talk about
    the goals of cognitive science and of cognitive scientists, and I will speculate
    about where we are going, and whether we really want to get there or not.</p>
